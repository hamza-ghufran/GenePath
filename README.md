# GenePath
Using Genetic Algorithms, small rocket objects try to find their path to the target. Later down the generations a Population of rocket is achieved in which each rocket-object is able to find it's path through the 'path' provided. It is up to the user to define what the shape of the 'path' will be. This is done using Open frameworks and Visual Studio.
